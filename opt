Code is currently completely unoptimized (though algorithmically solid and
probably fast enough).  Avenues for improvement when/if necessary:

- Elide locks (weaker synchronization guarantees)
- Patch vorbis/etc. do one indirect call instead of two for datasrc read
  - ~Inline cache -> direct call for datasrc read
- No copy when decoding from memory
- Custom allocator.  Make everything contiguous.  Guard for
  data/sample/...context immediately following container to avoid the
  indirection; otherwise prefetch while we wait for the indirect call
- Multiple mix/stream/... threads (but this could be worse for latency?  Maybe
  do work-stealing + min chunk size >> sync overhead?)
